Brief Introduction on how to use my app :

As a login user, you have a profile page, where you can edit your profile by clicking the pencil cog right next to your full name. Below the simple profile are the movie reviews you have posted. You can edit and delete your own review. You have access to your following list and follower list. In these two lists, you can navigate to the page that includes a certain user’s all reviews.

In Explore page, you can search the movie by title. Then, you can write review for a specific movie you select or read all the reviews this movie has.

Only Admin can have access to Admin page. 

Note: 
1，In Explore page, if the search feature doesn't work, please check whether your browser blocks pages trying to load scripts from unauthenticated source. 

2，Facebook considers my app’s Heroku url as malicious/abusive so that I can’t add my OAuth redirect URIs on Facebook Developer website.  I’m sorry for this situation, but google’s OAuth works fine.
